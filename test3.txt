The outcomes of phishing attacks are dramatically increasing every day. Attacks on financial services companies have been doubling each year compared to previous years. It is very important for companies to come up with new ways to solve phishing problems because it can become a major loss to well- known companies. Also, it can cause consumers to lose confidence in doing business online, which can affect many companies with an online presence. Not any type of technology can stop phishing attacks, but there are many ways to enable phishers from accomplishing their goals. Consumer education can increase the awareness of the phishing threat and other online vulnerabilities. Lastly, biometrics should become one of the major aspects and play an important role to combat phishing because it provides different steps to authenticate users.
