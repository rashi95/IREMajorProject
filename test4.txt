The SC-205/WG-71 joint Plenary is scheduled to finish the next update of the software certification standards for avion- ics by the end of this year. This includes the new DO- 178C/ED-12C for in flight software and DO-278A/ED-109A for ground-based software. This is the biggest change to the standards in the last decade. The new standards will provide clear guidance that can be used to qualify Java technology and verify realtime Java programs for use in avionics sys- tems.
