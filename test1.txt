In this talk, I will argue that complex sociotechnical systems like YouTube admit multiple conceptualizations - what YouTube is and is about - and that each of these perspectives ultimately results in different ways of posing research questions in multimedia. I will then contrast the existing lines of YouTube multimedia research under this view. In particular, I will discuss a perspective that put the focus on people - the You in YouTube â€“ and present an overview of ongoing work that aims at developing computational models to characterize YouTube as a collection of communities where individuals express and communicate through video. I will finally discuss opportunities for future research in multimedia under this framework.
